# vagrant-boxes

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/com/xtangle/vagrant-boxes.svg)](https://travis-ci.com/xtangle/vagrant-boxes)

This repository contains the Packer templates used create my [Vagrant base boxes](https://app.vagrantup.com/xtangle) on Vagrant Cloud.

The project structure, and most of the shell scripts found in the "packer-templates" folder are derived from Chef Software, Inc.'s [Bento project](https://github.com/chef/bento).
They have been modified to fit my use case.
